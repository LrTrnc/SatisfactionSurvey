The survey is done by buttons on a console which operates with the ESP32. The data is stored in a database, which is hosted on our Raspberry Pi. To communicate with the database, we send our data over MQTT to our MQTT-broker. In our product the Raspberry Pi works as the MQTT-broker, the host of our database and the host of our webpage. The webpage will be used as the visualizer from the collected satisfaction measurements data. Furthermore, we want to give our customers a secure console by building our own private network with integrated firewalls.
